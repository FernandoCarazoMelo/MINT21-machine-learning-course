Instead of looking at small 3x3 matrix toy examples, thought it would be good to compile all of the functions with a regular dataset. The Iowa dataset is relatable, the sale price of houses are somewhat inituitve, and all the data can fit locally on the computer.  \n",

This is often used to rank predictions for classification scores (listed below)\n",

That is, it has a size that consistently and helpfully reflects the objective function's geometry, making it easier to select an appropriate step size and get to the optimum in fewer steps.\n",
